# Hidden & Dangerous Deluxe

Free Game from http://oldsite.hidden-and-dangerous.net/deluxe/download.php

- Method of Play: LAN-Mode over Public-IP
- Needs port forwarding
- Needs this patch: https://github.com/WJLiddy/HDDMultiplayerPatch

## Port forwarding

You can choose your own port. I use 2302 - UDP and TCP

## Connecting

![Important](../../res/important.png)

When Starting the game for the first time, upon entering or hosting a Multiplayer match, a Firewall message will pop up, if the Game can access the firewall.
Tab out of the Game (Alt + Tab) and give the Permission. If the Game crashes when Tabbing back in, just start it again, your firewall-Choice is saved and you won't be asked again.

### Host

Go to "Network-Play"
then "Online-Options" and select "TCP/IP (Internet, LAN)".

Go back and click "HOST" 

Give your friends your public ipv4 IP. To find it, go to https://www.whatismyip.com/

## Â Connect

Go to "Network-Play"
then "Online-Options" and select "TCP/IP (Internet, LAN)".

Underneath "TCP-IP Options", put in your Friends public-IP and the chosen port.

Go back and click Connect.
